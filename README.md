# DiscordBot_v2

### This project has been abandonded and is no longer supported.

This is also another checkpoint in my coding career, as you can see there are tons of improovements from DiscordBot_v1. This showcases around a year of kowledge and undertanding, after the last bot I made. It's still not the greatest, but knowing how when I started making this, I had around 1 year of coding experience in TOTAL!!!

### Thank you all for being supportive and working with me as I learn to become a better developer.
### I know the code in this repo isn't the cleanest, or most efficient or effective, but that is part of the learning proccess.
